Kinesio(name of my brother's clinic)

This is a scheduling app that I'm trying to build for my brother's clinic.

It will utilize Ruby on Rails on the backend and later on 
use React on some parts of the front-end. 

This app is still in the early development stages.

Don't hold your breath for the production stage :)
